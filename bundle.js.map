調理行為と情報の関係性とフィジカルプロトタイプの制作\",\"createdAt\":\"2017-01-04\",\"path\":\"/tau-master\",\"body\":\"<p>この記事では、大学院での研究内容をまとめています。</p>\\n<h2>なぜこの研究テーマを選んだか</h2>\\n<p>インタラクションデザインを研究することを目的に大学院へ入学した僕は、良い題材となりそうなテーマを探していました。その中で、料理には様々な道具、複雑な情報が溢れているにもかかわらず、紙やウェブ、動画でレシピを解説する以上のサポートを実際に行えてはいないと感じました。そこで、どういったインターフェイスや情報設計があれば、料理や料理に付随する活動をより楽しく便利にできるかを研究することに決めました。</p>\\n<h2>論文要約</h2>\\n<h3>1. 研究の目的</h3>\\n<p>本研究の目的は、食に関わる情報と人との関係（インタラクション）から情報技術による支援についてのデザインを研究することである。料理におけるインタラクションデザインの基礎研究として、調理中の行為を中心に調理のためのインタラクションデザインの研究を行う。</p>\\n<h3>2. 研究の方法</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>料理における行為と思考、食材と道具の扱われかたを観察し、料理を構造化する方法を探る。</li>\\n<li>構造化された情報からインタラクションモデルを抽出することで、調理を支援するための行為と情報の関係性を見出す。</li>\\n<li>その関係性をもとに、プロトタイプの制作を行いながら調理支援のありかたを考察する探索的な方法をとる。</li>\\n<li>プロトタイプを元に、新しいインターフェース／コンテンツについて研究、制作を行う。</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>3. 観察</h3>\\n<p>まず、調理の観察を行う。調理中における情報利用の実態を把握するためには、記憶の再現によって行う調理である日常化された調理から行為と情報を抜き出すことが重要である。それは、調理中に情報を提供する仕組みを考える際に、すでに存在するレシピが削ぎ落してしまった部分が重要になる可能性があるためである。<br>\\n本稿では、2種類の観察を行っており、観察Aは夕食を作るすべての過程を観察し、観察Bはひとつの料理を作る過程をより詳細に観察している。</p>\\n<h3>4. 調理の記述と構造化</h3>\\n<p>調理における行為と、それに伴う情報利用の目的を明らかにしていくために、観察で得\\nた調理のプロセスを構造化する。</p>\\n<h3>5. プロトタイプ</h3>\\n<p>観察、記述、構造化をふまえ、調理におけるインタラクションのプロトタイプを制作し、評価実験を行う。<br>\\n図1のプロトタイプ（じゃがいもの下ごしらえ）は、調理中の自然な「行為」で提示される情報を変化させることができた場合における印象や価値を検証することを目的として制作した。<br>\\n図2のプロトタイプ（カレー）は、調理中のサポート機器としてどのような情報をどのように表示するか、といった表現方法やインターフェースを研究することを目的として制作した。</p>\\n<h3>6. 調理行為のヴィジュアライズ</h3>\\n<p>調理をサポートするインタラクションのプロトタイプから、その中で扱われるコンテンツや道具と行為の関係を重視したインタラクションの重要性を確認した。そこで、調理中の行為と関連するコンテンツとして、調理行為そのものの動きやリズムを視覚化する「調理行為のヴィジュアライズ」についての制作を行う［図3］。</p>\\n<h3>7. 考察</h3>\\n<p>プロトタイプの制作から、以下のようなことが明らかになった。</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>支援情報は常に表示されている必要は無い。</li>\\n<li>調理情報は、利用者の熟達度に応じて表示分けできるシステムの構築が重要となる。</li>\\n<li>調理行為を伝えるひとつの手段として、調理行為の視覚化が有効である。</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>これらを元にして、新しいインターフェースの制作を行う。</p>\\n<h3>8. まな板インターフェース</h3>\\n<p>これはタッチインターフェースを持つまな板のプロトタイプである［図4, 5, 6］。知りたい情報を必要なときに必要な量だけ閲覧でき、情報をモジュールとし稼働性を持たせたことで調理中に扱いやすくなっている。<br>\\nまな板型のケースにiPadを挿入し、まな板として使用しながら情報を操作できるようになっている。</p>\\n<h3>9. 結論</h3>\\n<p>本研究では、人の行為と情報の関係性から調理中に利用する情報インターフェースを制作した。今後は、そのインターフェースの実現可能性を固めるとともに、コンテンツについての研究も行っていきたい。</p>\\n<h2>日本デザイン学会発表</h2>\\n<p>2012年6月22日（金）〜24日（日）に札幌市立大学芸術の森キャンパスで開催された日本デザイン学会

class=\\\"Caption\\\">よりシンプルだと感じさせるように調整したUI案</p>\\n<h2>技術選定</h2>\\n<p>デザインプロトタイピングと並行して、スマホアプリを開発するための技術選定を行いました。僕たちのチームでSwiftやJavaを書ける人がいなかったため、当時の選択肢としてPhoneGapかReactNativeか、またはSwift・Javaを学ぶか、というのがありました。技術選定及びフロントの開発は、僕と岡田（<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/moqada\\\">@moqada</a>）で行っています。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v033.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">コードを書きすぎた結果</p>\\n<p>それまでReactjsでの開発を行っていたことと、PhoneGapでのパフォーマンスの低さを体感していたため、まずはReactNativeが本当に<strong>使えるのか</strong>を確認するためのプロトタイピングを行いました。</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>ReactNativeはJavaScriptでiOS・Androidアプリを開発できるフレームワークです。 <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\\\">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>ところで、<a href=\\\"https://toggl.com/\\\">toggl</a> というサービスをご存知でしょうか？タイムトラッカーサービスですが、このTogglは使い勝手の良いAPIを提供してくれています。このAPIを使ってTogglクライアントをReactNativeで作成することで、フロントサイドだけでプロトタイピングができるのではないかと考えました。</p>\\n<h3>ReactNativeの書き味</h3>\\n<p>まずはReactNativeのチュートリアルをFlux・Reduxを導入した形に書き直し、書き味を確かめました。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ideyuta/rnTutorialMovies\\\">https://github.com/ideyuta/rnTutorialMovies</a></li>\\n<li><a

href=\\\"https://github.com/ideyuta/rnReduxSample\\\">https://github.com/ideyuta/rnReduxSample</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>当時のReactNativeのバージョンが0.11（現時点で0.39までリリースされています）で、Androidへの対応はまだまだという感じでしたが、まずはiOSでどこまでいけるのかを確認しました。</p>\\n<h3>プロトタイプ開発</h3>\\n<p>作成したTogglクライアント「こしあん」です。\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/tongariboyz/koshian\\\">https://github.com/tongariboyz/koshian</a><br>\\nReactNative+Reduxという、2015年11月当時の最新スタックを導入してテストしています。</p>\\n<p>このプロトタイピングによって、ReactNativeがNative言語で開発したようなパフォーマンスを発揮できることが確認できたため、ReactNativeで開発を進めることを決定しました。</p>\\n<h2>本番開発</h2>\\n<p>本番の開発は、2016年1月から始まりました。UIデザインを元にユーザーストーリーを洗い出し、仕様を仮定義していきした。</p>\\n<p>この時点で、基幹システムや外部サービスとの連携は十分には行えておらず、全体的なサービスの仕様は全く決まっていませんでした。しかし、アプリの開発には時間がかかることが予測されていたため、アプリが必要とする単位でAPIを仮定義して開発を進めることにしました。</p>\\n<p>バックエンドの仕様が確定した部分からアプリとつなぐAPIをFIXさせていきました。リリースの直前までAPIの変更がありましたが、阿吽の呼吸で開発を進められるレベルに訓練された開発チームだったことがなんとか乗り切れた理由かと思います。</p>\\n<p>およそ9ヶ月の開発期間は、技術の変遷の激しいフロントエンドとしては長く、ReactNativeの内部コードも大きく変わりました。常に最新に追従しつつ開発していたため、手戻りが発生することも多くありましたが、その中で技術力が向上した感触もありました。</p>\\n<p>結果的にiOS、AndroidともにワンソースでリリースできたのでReactNativeを選択したことはよかったかなと感じています。</p>\\n<h3>OSSのフル活用</h3>\\n<p>ReactNativeの良いところは、npmを利用して公開パッケージを簡単に利用できる点があります。コード自体はJavaScriptなので、これまでの膨大な資産が活かせるとともに、ReactNative用のComponentやLibraryの開発も活発です。</p>\\n<p>例えば<a href=\\\"https://github.com/exponentjs\\\">exponentjs</a>という会社は優れたOSSを多数公開しています。</p>\\n<p>OSSをプロダクションに積極的に取り入れるようになってから、OSSの内部コードを読むことが多くなりました。その中でより良い設計のパターンやデザインを発見したり、JavaScriptの基礎知識を多く学びました。</p>\\n<h3>UIの最終調整・変更</h3>\\n<p>開発中にUIを触り続けているので、細かい不整合などは気づいた時点で吸収しながらデザインの調整を行いました。<br>\\n3人の開発チーム（フロントは1.5人）で進めていたため、<strong>コードが複雑化しないデザイン</strong>であることも重視していました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v012.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">実装可能性を考慮し最終調整したUI</p>\\n<p>合わせて最終的なカラー定義も作成しています。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v017.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">カラー定義</p>\\n<h2>カード券面</h2>\\n<p>カード券面のデザインは、本番開発とは切り離されたスケジュールで進んでいました。Visa・印刷会社・基幹システム・カンム間で多くのやりとりが行われるため、非常にスケジュールが立てづらくなっていたからです。</p>\\n<p>カード券面は、当初から真っ白のカードでいこうと決まっていました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v015.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">カード券面</p>\\n<p>なぜ白いカードにしようと思ったのか。それは最もシンプルなカードを作りたいという思いがあったからです。アップルの陶器のような白さを持つカードが出来たら、昨今のよくわからないグラフィックで覆われたカードよりも魅力的になるのではないかと考えました。</p>\\n<p>実際のカードは、印刷会社の制約によって理想とはだいぶかけ離れた仕上がりとなっています。色やフォントの制約が多く存在し、カスタマイズはできません（多くのお金をかければできるとも言えます）。また、印刷品質の低さや印字の汚さなどの問題もあります。自分の力のなさを嘆きたくなりました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v019.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">バーチャルカード券面</p>\\n<h2>シンボル</h2>\\n<p>シンボルマークはかなり悩みました。もともとロゴやマークは得意分野ではなく、良いものができたとはあまり思っていません…。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>カードであることがわかる</li>\\n<li>常に新しいことを取り入れていくカードである</li>\\n<li>堅苦しさのないカードである</li>\\n<li>どこよりも柔軟に社会の変化に対応するカードである</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>以上のような考えを元に、カードのイメージをベースとしてたまごや小鳥のようなイメージを合わせてシンボルを作成しました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v016.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">シンボルマーク</p>\\n<h2>ネーミング</h2>\\n<p>バンドルカードは、ValueとHandleから作った造語です。よりよくお金を使えるようにするというビジョンの元、このカードは価値を扱いやすくしてくれるものであるという考えからつけた名前です。</p>\\n<p>シンボルマークとも、「鳥」をキーワードに印象がぶれないようにと考えましたが、そううまくいっているかはちょっとわかりません…。</p>\\n<h2>パッケージ</h2>\\n<p>プラスチックカードを送付するためのパッケージを作成しました。\\nカード、説明書、カード台紙、封筒、宛名シールなど、をいかに<strong>単価を最小にして簡単に封入できる形にするか</strong>を検討しました。</p>\\n<p>送付のオペレーション上、カード裏面にあるIDをユーザーと結びつける必要があり、外部に委託するには精密なアセンブリ設計をする必要があることがわかりました。また、アセンブリ工程の複雑さが費用の増加に直結するため、いかに単純化、分担化できるかが問題となりました。</p>\\n<p>まずは、台紙をなくし、ビニールの袋にすべてを包むようにすることでコスト減と作業の簡略化を実現しています。（特殊な台紙の印刷よりもビニールの袋の方が安価、かつアセンブリ作業が簡単）</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v018.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">パッケージ</p>\\n<p>ほとんどの他社カードが定形封筒の味気ない形で送られてくる中で、僕らはそれを変えるべきだと考えていました。カード会社が物理的な接点を持つ機会として、リアルカードの送付という接点は非常に重要です。</p>\\n<p>ユーザーに驚きを与えられるような、そんな送付パッケージにしたいという思いがありました。革のカードケースに入って送られてきたら嬉しいんじゃないかとか、そういったことを考えながら試作や業者との連携を進めていましたが、現実的に難しいという結果になりました。</p>\\n<p>物理的な送付物を用意しオペレーションを整備するのは想像以上に難易度が高く、費用という意味でも妥協せざる負えない部分が多々ありました。</p>\\n<h2>ランディングページ</h2>\\n<p>2016年7月11日、ランディングページを公開しました。これまで作成してきたリソースを使い、2週間程でデザインから開発まで行っています。<a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\\\">gatsbyjs</a>というReactベースのサイトジェネレータを使って作成しています。</p>\\n<p>このライブラリの良いところはJavaScriptで記述できることで、webpackが組み込まれておりReact、PostCSSといったアセットを標準で持っていることです。さらにサーバサイドレンダリングでHTMLファイルをパブリッシュできるので、SEOの観点から見ても問題がないというのもあります。</p>\\n<p>また、Markdownでも簡単に記事ページを作成することができる点も大きいです。</p>\\n<p><img

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

研究の方法</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>料理における行為と思考、食材と道具の扱われかたを観察し、料理を構造化する方法を探る。</li>\\n<li>構造化された情報からインタラクションモデルを抽出することで、調理を支援するための行為と情報の関係性を見出す。</li>\\n<li>その関係性をもとに、プロトタイプの制作を行いながら調理支援のありかたを考察する探索的な方法をとる。</li>\\n<li>プロトタイプを元に、新しいインターフェース／コンテンツについて研究、制作を行う。</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>3. 観察</h3>\\n<p>まず、調理の観察を行う。調理中における情報利用の実態を把握するためには、記憶の再現によって行う調理である日常化された調理から行為と情報を抜き出すことが重要である。それは、調理中に情報を提供する仕組みを考える際に、すでに存在するレシピが削ぎ落してしまった部分が重要になる可能性があるためである。<br>\\n本稿では、2種類の観察を行っており、観察Aは夕食を作るすべての過程を観察し、観察Bはひとつの料理を作る過程をより詳細に観察している。</p>\\n<h3>4. 調理の記述と構造化</h3>\\n<p>調理における行為と、それに伴う情報利用の目的を明らかにしていくために、観察で得\\nた調理のプロセスを構造化する。</p>\\n<h3>5. プロトタイプ</h3>\\n<p>観察、記述、構造化をふまえ、調理におけるインタラクションのプロトタイプを制作し、評価実験を行う。<br>\\n図1のプロトタイプ（じゃがいもの下ごしらえ）は、調理中の自然な「行為」で提示される情報を変化させることができた場合における印象や価値を検証することを目的として制作した。<br>\\n図2のプロトタイプ（カレー）は、調理中のサポート機器としてどのような情報をどのように表示するか、といった表現方法やインターフェースを研究することを目的として制作した。</p>\\n<h3>6. 調理行為のヴィジュアライズ</h3>\\n<p>調理をサポートするインタラクションのプロトタイプから、その中で扱われるコンテンツや道具と行為の関係を重視したインタラクションの重要性を確認した。そこで、調理中の行為と関連するコンテンツとして、調理行為そのものの動きやリズムを視覚化する「調理行為のヴィジュアライズ」についての制作を行う［図3］。</p>\\n<h3>7. 考察</h3>\\n<p>プロトタイプの制作から、以下のようなことが明らかになった。</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>支援情報は常に表示されている必要は無い。</li>\\n<li>調理情報は、利用者の熟達度に応じて表示分けできるシステムの構築が重要となる。</li>\\n<li>調理行為を伝えるひとつの手段として、調理行為の視覚化が有効である。</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>これらを元にして、新しいインターフェースの制作を行う。</p>\\n<h3>8. まな板インターフェース</h3>\\n<p>これはタッチインターフェースを持つまな板のプロトタイプである［図4, 5, 6］。知りたい情報を必要なときに必要な量だけ閲覧でき、情報をモジュールとし稼働性を持たせたことで調理中に扱いやすくなっている。<br>\\nまな板型のケースにiPadを挿入し、まな板として使用しながら情報を操作できるようになっている。</p>\\n<h3>9. 結論</h3>\\n<p>本研究では、人の行為と情報の関係性から調理中に利用する情報インターフェースを制作した。今後は、そのインターフェースの実現可能性を固めるとともに、コンテンツについての研究も行っていきたい。</p>\\n<h2>日本デザイン学会発表</h2>\\n<p>2012年6月22日（金）〜24日（日）に札幌市立大学芸術の森キャンパスで開催された日本デザイン学会

class=\\\"Caption\\\">サマリー表示を軸としたUI案</p>\\n<p>期間表示を簡単に操作できるようなUI案も作成しています。カレンダーUIを使って、日付や指定期間で利用履歴をみることができます。一週間など期間を指定し、横スワイプで移動できるようなUIも考えました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v009.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">期間表示を軸としたUI案</p>\\n<p>この辺りから、カードをアプリ上に表示する方法を考え始めています。また、全体的なデザインのトーン・マナーについての調整も始めました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v010.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">シンプルな見た目とカードらしさを表現するUI案</p>\\n<p>リサーチの結果、金融系アプリは概して複雑に見えるという事実がありました。差別化の目的もあり、バンドルカードでは<strong>シンプルに見える</strong>ということを重視しようと決め、調整を始めました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v011.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">よりシンプルだと感じさせるように調整したUI案</p>\\n<h2>技術選定</h2>\\n<p>デザインプロトタイピングと並行して、スマホアプリを開発するための技術選定を行いました。僕たちのチームでSwiftやJavaを書ける人がいなかったため、当時の選択肢としてPhoneGapかReactNativeか、またはSwift・Javaを学ぶか、というのがありました。技術選定及びフロントの開発は、僕と岡田（<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/moqada\\\">@moqada</a>）で行っています。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v033.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">コードを書きすぎた結果</p>\\n<p>それまでReactjsでの開発を行っていたことと、PhoneGapでのパフォーマンスの低さを体感していたため、まずはReactNativeが本当に<strong>使えるのか</strong>を確認するためのプロトタイピングを行いました。</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>ReactNativeはJavaScriptでiOS・Androidアプリを開発できるフレームワークです。 <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\\\">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>ところで、<a href=\\\"https://toggl.com/\\\">toggl</a> というサービスをご存知でしょうか？タイムトラッカーサービスですが、このTogglは使い勝手の良いAPIを提供してくれています。このAPIを使ってTogglクライアントをReactNativeで作成することで、フロントサイドだけでプロトタイピングができるのではないかと考えました。</p>\\n<h3>ReactNativeの書き味</h3>\\n<p>まずはReactNativeのチュートリアルをFlux・Reduxを導入した形に書き直し、書き味を確かめました。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ideyuta/rnTutorialMovies\\\">https://github.com/ideyuta/rnTutorialMovies</a></li>\\n<li><a

href=\\\"https://github.com/ideyuta/rnReduxSample\\\">https://github.com/ideyuta/rnReduxSample</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>当時のReactNativeのバージョンが0.11（現時点で0.39までリリースされています）で、Androidへの対応はまだまだという感じでしたが、まずはiOSでどこまでいけるのかを確認しました。</p>\\n<h3>プロトタイプ開発</h3>\\n<p>作成したTogglクライアント「こしあん」です。\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/tongariboyz/koshian\\\">https://github.com/tongariboyz/koshian</a><br>\\nReactNative+Reduxという、2015年11月当時の最新スタックを導入してテストしています。</p>\\n<p>このプロトタイピングによって、ReactNativeがNative言語で開発したようなパフォーマンスを発揮できることが確認できたため、ReactNativeで開発を進めることを決定しました。</p>\\n<h2>本番開発</h2>\\n<p>本番の開発は、2016年1月から始まりました。UIデザインを元にユーザーストーリーを洗い出し、仕様を仮定義していきした。</p>\\n<p>この時点で、基幹システムや外部サービスとの連携は十分には行えておらず、全体的なサービスの仕様は全く決まっていませんでした。しかし、アプリの開発には時間がかかることが予測されていたため、アプリが必要とする単位でAPIを仮定義して開発を進めることにしました。</p>\\n<p>バックエンドの仕様が確定した部分からアプリとつなぐAPIをFIXさせていきました。リリースの直前までAPIの変更がありましたが、阿吽の呼吸で開発を進められるレベルに訓練された開発チームだったことがなんとか乗り切れた理由かと思います。</p>\\n<p>およそ9ヶ月の開発期間は、技術の変遷の激しいフロントエンドとしては長く、ReactNativeの内部コードも大きく変わりました。常に最新に追従しつつ開発していたため、手戻りが発生することも多くありましたが、その中で技術力が向上した感触もありました。</p>\\n<p>結果的にiOS、AndroidともにワンソースでリリースできたのでReactNativeを選択したことはよかったかなと感じています。</p>\\n<h3>OSSのフル活用</h3>\\n<p>ReactNativeの良いところは、npmを利用して公開パッケージを簡単に利用できる点があります。コード自体はJavaScriptなので、これまでの膨大な資産が活かせるとともに、ReactNative用のComponentやLibraryの開発も活発です。</p>\\n<p>例えば<a href=\\\"https://github.com/exponentjs\\\">exponentjs</a>という会社は優れたOSSを多数公開しています。</p>\\n<p>OSSをプロダクションに積極的に取り入れるようになってから、OSSの内部コードを読むことが多くなりました。その中でより良い設計のパターンやデザインを発見したり、JavaScriptの基礎知識を多く学びました。</p>\\n<h3>UIの最終調整・変更</h3>\\n<p>開発中にUIを触り続けているので、細かい不整合などは気づいた時点で吸収しながらデザインの調整を行いました。<br>\\n3人の開発チーム（フロントは1.5人）で進めていたため、<strong>コードが複雑化しないデザイン</strong>であることも重視していました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v012.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">実装可能性を考慮し最終調整したUI</p>\\n<p>合わせて最終的なカラー定義も作成しています。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v017.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">カラー定義</p>\\n<h2>カード券面</h2>\\n<p>カード券面のデザインは、本番開発とは切り離されたスケジュールで進んでいました。Visa・印刷会社・基幹システム・カンム間で多くのやりとりが行われるため、非常にスケジュールが立てづらくなっていたからです。</p>\\n<p>カード券面は、当初から真っ白のカードでいこうと決まっていました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v015.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">カード券面</p>\\n<p>なぜ白いカードにしようと思ったのか。それは最もシンプルなカードを作りたいという思いがあったからです。アップルの陶器のような白さを持つカードが出来たら、昨今のよくわからないグラフィックで覆われたカードよりも魅力的になるのではないかと考えました。</p>\\n<p>実際のカードは、印刷会社の制約によって理想とはだいぶかけ離れた仕上がりとなっています。色やフォントの制約が多く存在し、カスタマイズはできません（多くのお金をかければできるとも言えます）。また、印刷品質の低さや印字の汚さなどの問題もあります。自分の力のなさを嘆きたくなりました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v019.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">バーチャルカード券面</p>\\n<h2>シンボル</h2>\\n<p>シンボルマークはかなり悩みました。もともとロゴやマークは得意分野ではなく、良いものができたとはあまり思っていません…。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>カードであることがわかる</li>\\n<li>常に新しいことを取り入れていくカードである</li>\\n<li>堅苦しさのないカードである</li>\\n<li>どこよりも柔軟に社会の変化に対応するカードである</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>以上のような考えを元に、カードのイメージをベースとしてたまごや小鳥のようなイメージを合わせてシンボルを作成しました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v016.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">シンボルマーク</p>\\n<h2>ネーミング</h2>\\n<p>バンドルカードは、ValueとHandleから作った造語です。よりよくお金を使えるようにするというビジョンの元、このカードは価値を扱いやすくしてくれるものであるという考えからつけた名前です。</p>\\n<p>シンボルマークとも、「鳥」をキーワードに印象がぶれないようにと考えましたが、そううまくいっているかはちょっとわかりません…。</p>\\n<h2>パッケージ</h2>\\n<p>プラスチックカードを送付するためのパッケージを作成しました。\\nカード、説明書、カード台紙、封筒、宛名シールなど、をいかに<strong>単価を最小にして簡単に封入できる形にするか</strong>を検討しました。</p>\\n<p>送付のオペレーション上、カード裏面にあるIDをユーザーと結びつける必要があり、外部に委託するには精密なアセンブリ設計をする必要があることがわかりました。また、アセンブリ工程の複雑さが費用の増加に直結するため、いかに単純化、分担化できるかが問題となりました。</p>\\n<p>まずは、台紙をなくし、ビニールの袋にすべてを包むようにすることでコスト減と作業の簡略化を実現しています。（特殊な台紙の印刷よりもビニールの袋の方が安価、かつアセンブリ作業が簡単）</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v018.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">パッケージ</p>\\n<p>ほとんどの他社カードが定形封筒の味気ない形で送られてくる中で、僕らはそれを変えるべきだと考えていました。カード会社が物理的な接点を持つ機会として、リアルカードの送付という接点は非常に重要です。</p>\\n<p>ユーザーに驚きを与えられるような、そんな送付パッケージにしたいという思いがありました。革のカードケースに入って送られてきたら嬉しいんじゃないかとか、そういったことを考えながら試作や業者との連携を進めていましたが、現実的に難しいという結果になりました。</p>\\n<p>物理的な送付物を用意しオペレーションを整備するのは想像以上に難易度が高く、費用という意味でも妥協せざる負えない部分が多々ありました。</p>\\n<h2>ランディングページ</h2>\\n<p>2016年7月11日、ランディングページを公開しました。これまで作成してきたリソースを使い、2週間程でデザインから開発まで行っています。<a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\\\">gatsbyjs</a>というReactベースのサイトジェネレータを使って作成しています。</p>\\n<p>このライブラリの良いところはJavaScriptで記述できることで、webpackが組み込まれておりReact、PostCSSといったアセットを標準で持っていることです。さらにサーバサイドレンダリングでHTMLファイルをパブリッシュできるので、SEOの観点から見ても問題がないというのもあります。</p>\\n<p>また、Markdownでも簡単に記事ページを作成することができる点も大きいです。</p>\\n<p><img

UI を変更しました。</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/vandlecard/v034.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"Caption\\\">複数カード対応 UI</p>\\n<p>この機能のデザインを終え、View 側の実装をほどほどに、僕のカンムとしての旅は終わりました。</p>\\n<h2>バンドルカード</h2>\\n<p>バンドルカードは、わかりやすく使いやすいカードがあるべきだと考えた奴らが作り、誰もがインターネットで決済できる世界に受け入れられ広まっています。</p>\\n<p>愚直に続けることがカンムの文化であり、最高のプロダクトを作るために全力を傾けているチームです。</p>\\n<p>ぜひこの記事を見てご興味が湧きましたらカンムまでご連絡ください。</p>\\n<p><a
